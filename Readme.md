# Microservice Code Template [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PageUpPeopleOrg/microservice-bootstrap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PageUpPeopleOrg/microservice-bootstrap)

A git repo that gives you a headstart on your own Microservice in [Dotnet Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

*_The intention is reduce the entry barrier in going with Microservices for .NET folks._*

The repo will help you to bootstrap two kind of Microservices,
* Web service
* Worker service

This will help you have a head start with,

1. Running a ASP.NET Microservice
2. Containerizing your service with Docker
3. Head start with CI / CD with Travis CI
4. Consume basic Kinesis event data streams

## Get Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Ensure you have Docker installed [download here](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
3. Setup environment variables (see below).
4. Set unique Kinesis stream name and worker id (see below).
5. Run `docker-compose up -d` from root folder of repo (or without `-d` to not run in daemon mode so you can see the console output from the web server)
6. Yay all up and running, Done! You can validate this by hitting [http://localhost:4001/healthcheck](http://localhost:4001/healthcheck) and ensuring you get 200 as the response code.

### Kinesis 

The code integrates with Kinesis by taking the source of the third-party library, KinesisNet, and updating it to be compatible with the .NET Core framework.

To begin consuming events, a KManager object is created using the appropriate environment variables and defining a unique workerId and kinesisStreamName. We then call kManager.Consume.Start by passing in an IRecordProcessor.

### Setup environment variables

The environment variables are setup for live when you deploy your infrastructure for the service.

For local deployment, you will have to setup the environment variables on your PC.

The following environment variables are required:
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (AWS keys obtained using instructions below)
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
* ENV (Set as your first name for local - this enables you to identify your own AWS resources)
* DC (Set as dc0 for local)
* REGION (Set as 'ap-southeast-2' for local)

### Obtain AWS Credentials
#### PageUp AWSCredentialsGenerator
To get this running on your PC follow the instructions [here](https://code.pageuppeople.com/diffusion/CREDGEN/)

#### Without the credentials generator
1. Generate AWS keys at [status.pageuppeople.com](https://status.pageuppeople.com/AWSToken/Token)
2. Once keys have been generated, run the bash scripts on that page to copy your credentials to your local environment
3. Run CopyAWSCredentialsToUserProfile.sh in the root of the project dir
4. Set a system variable for
    - ENV = {your_username} (this will become part of your table/queue namespace in AWS in DC0)
    - DC = DC0 (for local development)
    - IsLocalServer = true (for local development so that ES hits this API)
5. Restart VS for changes to take effect (if you get expiry errors while debugging restart visual studio again)
6. Run the CommentsAPI project in debug

### What if I just want worker service?
* Remove WebService & WebService.UnitTests projects from Visual Studio and delete the folder
* Remove its references from docker compose file
* Remove sections of travis yml referring to web service

### What if I just want Web Service?
* Remove WorkerService & WorkerService.UnitTests projects from Visual Studio and delete the folder.
* Remove its references from docker compose file
* Remove sections of travis yml referring to worker service

### How to ensure it is all good

Head to `http://192.168.99.100:4000/api/values` to see to web service running. Pat your own back!

Run `docker logs microservicebootstrap_workerservice_1` and see "Hello world" to confirm, your worker service is running. Pay your own back again!

### Deployment

Uncomment the relevant lines in deploy.sh to get DC2-7 deployment running.

## TODO

1. include basic dependency injection
2. Create a dotnet core branch - for enthusiasts
3. Include code coverage & complexity metrics
4. document: explain Dynamo table for current state storage of kinesis integration
5. document: explain what happens when a bad kinesis message comes in
6. document: missing features from LaunchPad TuneUp

## Template idea

The service is designed in mind considering the Principles of Microservices as documented by Sam Newman.

It's a [good video to watch](https://vimeo.com/131632250), if you haven't already.

### Deployment story
The template provides way to package the service as Docker container and uses Travis CI for CI.
However, I won't go into
1. how to manage the containers or
2. how to deploy the containers or
3. how to set up &/ manage docker cluster.

An option is to use Aws ECS / ECR to managing docker cluster and found it to be working (especially when your infra is hosted on aws).
